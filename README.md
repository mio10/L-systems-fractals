# Fractals generated with L-systems

## Description
A small collection of programs that generate some of well-known fractals using an algorithm based on L-systems. I wrote the program in 2017 when I was learning about fractals and L-systems in university. When developing this, I was highly inspired by the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) about L-systems.

## Requirements
[PascalABC.NET](http://pascalabc.net/en/download) is required to run the program.

## Quick start
1. Launch PascalABC.NET.
2. Open the file corresponding to a fractal image you want to see (`dragon.pas`, `fractal plant.pas` or `gosper.pas`).
3. Run the program.
